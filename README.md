Open Gallery-ui-challenge folder then click on index.html file to keep in touch to the gallery challenge.

You can also navigate to coding-challenge directory to run js challenges.

TO run this, it will require you to have node js installed on your environment, if you don't, please install it through "https://nodejs.org/".

Then run "node arrayMap.js" in your terminal to get what is in this challenge.

Run "node stringTransform.js" in your terminal to get what is in this challenge.

Here is another alternative to the one who doesn't have nodejs installed and don't even want to install it, use online compiller like https://onecompiler.com/javascript you can copy js code and run them in this environment.

Thanks.
